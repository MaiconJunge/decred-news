{introduction, major news of the month}

{Happy New Year}

Release candidates of core software v1.4.0 are available for download [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2). Enthusiasts are free to try them while regular users are advised to wait for the final release. As always, [verify the signatures](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/verifying-binaries/) to ensure the software is coming unaltered directly from the developers.

## Development

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): v1.4.0 RC2 was released. This version includes the [smart fee estimator](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1434) that allows to either minimize mining delay or the fee, depending on what the user needs. The feature is important for Lightning Network and as a general mechanism to handle network congestion, more details in its [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412). Whitelisted inbound peers are now [allowed](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1516) regardless of connection limit so that operators can always allow their own SPV clients. Several performace improvements to initial sync, validation and network operations are included. Users choosing to upgrade should note there is a one-time database migration which will take 30-60 minutes depending on hardware. See full list of changes in the [release notes](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2).

A [vulnerability](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q4/254) was patched in `go get` tool that allowed remote code execution when using a malicious repository. dcrd and dcrwallet were _not affected_ because they recently switched to a more secure modules system. Latest versions of dependencies are not automatically grabbed like they are in npm. Additionally, for dcrd all changes to dependencies except the Go runtime are audited. That is part of the reason it takes so much effort to prepare dcrd releases and why the number of dependencies should be limited. More details in [this chat](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$154476448242812wqgkf:decred.org)

Discussion [started](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1556) to implement Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) in dcrd.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): v1.4.0 RC2 release fixes a lot of bugs related to SPV and error handling and adds a host of new gRPC endpoints that will enable new features in end user UIs. Tor connections from dcrwallet to dcrd node are now possible with the [proxy mode](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1294). Default transaction relay fee was dropped to 0.0001 DCR given sufficient network upgrades. More changes in the [release notes](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2).

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): v1.4.0 RC2 release features initial Trezor support, design improvements and many bug fixes. Initial [Trezor support](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1547) allows users to use Decrediton as a "watch-only" wallet that signs transactions with Trezor. The feature will be hidden behind a config option until it gets enough testing. Staking is not supported yet but is planned in the near future. More generally, watch-only wallets are now able to [create unsigned transactions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1864) that can be transferred to another device for signing and broadcasting. Governance page received a large overhaul and an important feature to [notify](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1835) users about new proposals and votes. New page to [enable SPV mode](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1766) is now shown on first load. Initial dark theme can be enabled in Settings (the colors are being finalized). More details for these and other changes are in [release notes](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc2).

On the master branch (i.e. not included in the 1.4 release), Decrediton can now be built for [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1904).

A lot of [design work](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Alinnutee+created%3A2018-12-01..2018-12-31) is completed and ready for implementation.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): latest [security tightening](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/935) earned Politeia an A+ rating from [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/?q=test-proposals.decred.org&followRedirects=on), which put it into the site's top 3% and (briefly) to the Hall of Fame. A feature to view [old proposal versions](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/949) is added as part of building the [version diff](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/973) viewer, which needs more polish. politeiavoter now [retries failed requests](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/639) which fixes Tor usage. Comment vote score calculation was fixed by [moving](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/610) it from politeiad to politeiawww. Proposals now [cannot be abandoned](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/936) after voting was authorized. These and smaller fixes will be available on the [proposals](https://proposals.decred.org/) site after the next deployment.

In progress are admin [data backups](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/605) and two big changes to scale the server: [cache layer](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/546) and [websockets support](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/547).

[Android wallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): v1.0.0 release candidate 2 is available on Google Play for [mainnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet) and [testnet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.testnet). Seed verification and seed restore interfaces were completely redone, several bugs fixed. The list of improvements can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/tree/v1.0.0-rc2).

Next RC to be released shortly will include several minor bug fixes as well as a better display of the status during initial sync which was requested by a handful of people.

Focus has been on the streamlining the setup experience for new users since thats the first thing they will see and can sometimes be tedious. 

Limitations of wallet encryption and risks of staking on insecure Android smartphones was discussed in [this chat](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$154533559847474ZIrlD:decred.org).

[iOS wallet](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): has mostly just been syncing up with the changes from Android. iOS testing releases will be made available as soon as Android 1.0 is done.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): v3.1.1 is released on [explorer.dcrdata.org](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/). Highlights include new pages for [sidechains](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/side) and [disapproved blocks](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/rejects), major performance improvements, Go modules support, non-javascript mode [improvements](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/852) _(thanks from an anti-js dinosaur!)_. See full release notes [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/releases/tag/v3.1.0). The release includes 129 commits from 4 months of work made by 16 code contributors. Congrats to dcrdata team!

On master, a feature to download transactions for a single address [as a CSV](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/pull/894) is finished. Several refactors are merged to employ modern frontend best practices.

Public dcrdata Tor service was temporarily shut down after a DDoS attack. After some [discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!YwropUjOvDAjfbVSzi:decred.org/$154480347443065mKiKp:decred.org) it was brought back at [dcrdata2opeenddl.onion](http://dcrdata2opeenddl.onion/).

Developers can check the new [Docker image](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocker/pull/45) to build and test dcrdata and a new [FAQ page](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/wiki/FAQ) on the wiki.

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): [v0.7.0](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.7.0) and [v0.7.2](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases/tag/v0.7.2) released. Highlights: SPV client support (read for privacy caveats), better security with session token, OpenBSD support and better reporting. Find the downloads [on GitHub](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/releases). As always, verify the signatures to make sure the binaries really come from @matheusd.

[docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs): building on redirection infrastructure laid out earlier, work began to [tidy up URLs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/issues/659) and directory structure. Agenda Voting was [changed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/733) to Consensus Rules Voting. Translation framework was [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/issues/736). Glossary received a few more terms. [Added](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/726) new [guide for SPV](https://docs.decred.org/wallets/spv/). [Updated](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/758) Politeia docs by grouping Politeia pages together, adding pages for [Proposal Guidelines](https://docs.decred.org/governance/politeia/proposal-guidelines/) page and [Example Proposal](https://docs.decred.org/governance/politeia/example-proposals/).

[decred.org](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb): page headers were [changed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/457) from javascript to videos, Rocket.Chat [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/460) from the Community page, Decred Business Brief is now available as a [web page](https://decred.org/brief/) in addition to the PDF download.

## People

Welcome to new first time contributors: [aerth](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/commits?author=aerth) (dcrwallet), [@guang](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/commits?author=Guang168) (decrediton), [tpkeeper](https://github.com/decred/politeia/commits?author=tpkeeper) (politeia).

[30000fps](http://30000fps.com) has been a Decred design contributor since 2018 summer. One goal of his works has been about bringing a spotlight to the developments by finding meaningful ways to visualize and illustrate the processes and features otherwise unseen. Examples can be seen from the recent development visuals (upcoming [v1.4.0 release](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17774057/50576201-3e124e80-0e15-11e9-83cd-28b50cfd9357.gif) (4 MB), [Politeia release](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1052203697986363392), [v1.3.0 release](https://twitter.com/decredproject/status/1044693349205200896)), as well the [overhaul](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/27) of decred.org subpage headers.

3 contributors were [removed](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/472) from the decred.org website.

Several contractors shared their onboarding experiences [in this chat](https://matrix.to/#/!lbzTjhzNbIaDbuAxkS:decred.org/$154508806344819aIkBV:decred.org), which is a good, first-hand account to read in order to understand what the onboarding process might look like, particularly of note to those potentially interested in becoming Decred contractors. @richardred published an excellent [Working for the Decred DAE](https://medium.com/@richardred/working-for-the-decred-dae-a9cfb17686fa) that covers his Decred journey in greater detail.

## Governance

## Network

Hashrate: December's hashrate opened at around 167 Ph/s and closed around 183 Ph/s, peaking at 207 Ph/s and bottoming at 110 Ph/s throughout the course of the month, averaging, for the most part, at around 150 Ph/s. BeePool's share of the hashrate varied wildly between 1.3%-29%, same for F2Pool at 2.8%-49%, Luxor 1%-6.5%, Coinmine 1%-2%. Unknown hashrate accounted for 45%-70% of the entire network's computing power with a low 33% and peak of 87%. Pool distribution numbers are approximate and cannot be accurately determined.

Staking: 30-day average ticket price was 103 DCR. The price varied between 101.33 DCR and 107.09 DCR, with 4.14-4.23 million DCR locked, with highs and lows of 45.53%-46.23% of available supply at the time.

Nodes: As of Jan. 4 there are 211 public listening nodes and 269 normal ones per [dcred.eu](https://dcred.eu/nodeStats). Version distribution: 5.2% are v1.5.0 (pre) dev builds (+100%), 3.3% are v1.4.0 (rc1) (+100%), 13.4% are v1.4.0 (pre) (+6.9%), 43% are v1.3.0 (-7%), 28% are running v.1.2.0 (+3%), 16% are on v1.1.2 (+5%) and 7% are on v.1.1.0 (+2%).

Block 300,000 was mined this month. The mined DCR is now over 9,000,000! Congratulations to all!

{OTC desks}

{payment processors}

{wallets}

The hardware wallet company Ledger [tweeted](https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/1072446149863329792) that the long-awaited DCR integration into their Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue was complete.

> We are excited to announce that the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue are now compatible with Decred. Decred is now available on Ledger Live and marks the first native Ledger Live integration since its launch. Read more here: https://www.ledger.fr/2018/12/11/ledger-nano-s-ledger-blue-and-ledger-live-now-support-decred-transactions/

DCR storage is possible through Ledger Live, an application that now acts as a one-stop-shop for accessing and interacting with your crypto assets since Ledger discontinued the use of their respective apps earlier this year.
{explain:

* is firmware open source?}

Cobo Wallet [announced](https://twitter.com/cobo_wallet/status/1070805250376900609) a custodial staking service. Please do your research to understand the implications like who controls the keys, whether you lose consensus and Politeia voting rights, and so on.

## Outreach

{overview of outreach/communications/marketing activity for past month and any short-term plans}

December marked an exciting month for Decred, as Ditto began work. The first initiative was to make introductions and determine workflow. You'll now see our good friends, Liz Bagot, Trey Ditto, Margaret Mei, Blain Rethmeier, and Milvian Preito in various Matrix rooms, including Marketing, Ditto PR, and DCR Writers.

Work began in earnest on messaging, which can be viewed here. Continued input is always valued. Concurrently, we're working with the design team to integrate new messaging into the site and to expand the content with new pages further explaining important aspects of Decred.

Messaging should be agreed upon in January, and a work will begin on the website. A plan including events and other tactics will also be published in January.

Ditto people joined #marketing and the room was very hot throughout the month. There was a lot of brainstorming and deciding on messaging.

@Dustorf, @jy-p and Ditto met in New York, report available [here](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154413732235771XIVBH:decred.org), where, amongst other things, they discussed challenges related to attracting new developers and contributors, spreading the word about Decred to knowledgeable investors, institutions, and governments, as well as going over the long term vision for the project.

@liz_bagot gave the inaugural Ditto Bi-Weekly Update [here](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154482468943386bBAIp:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org).

Update from Ditto for December:

* Had a 2.5-hour onboarding session with Dustin and Jake in our Brooklyn office in early December.
* Created a foundational messaging platform containing a breakdown of Decred's audiences, an about section, a mission statement, a vision statement, and positioning statements for each unique audience. We [submitted](https://matrix.to/#/!OfChXgczrIlpEZSFAv:decred.org/$154524074346294yVYFR:decred.org) the messaging platform to the Decred community for feedback and intend to do another iteration of the document that incorporates the feedback in January.
* Attended and sent reporters from Breaker Mag, Forbes, and Fortune to Decred's meet up in NYC.
* Arranged and staffed interviews between couple big outlets and Decred community members. No set publication dates yet.
* We pitched Jake's commentary on 2019 crypto predictions with crypto reporters and secured coverage in [NullTX](https://nulltx.com/decred-co-founder-pronounces-2018-as-the-death-of-the-ico-model/), [Crypto Briefing](https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-2019-institutional-adoption/), [The Daily Hodl](https://dailyhodl.com/2018/12/21/after-bitcoin-rallies-18-industry-insiders-weigh-in-on-a-bull-run-and-cryptos-next-turn/), and [CCN](https://www.ccn.com/2018-in-4-words-icos-and-ethereum-are-dead/).

Murad Mahmudov suggests to focus the messaging on store of value aspect: https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15459293712709dEJuG:decred.org {keep?}

## Events

Attended:

* {}

Decred held it's first meetup in NYC on Wednesday, December 5th at Distributed Global in the flatiron district in NYC. The audience of about 80 people included VC's, developers from other projects, media, and members of the Decred community. Project Lead, Jake Yocom-Piatt, gave an Decred overview presentation, then delved into the technical details of the Politeia Proposal System including how it works and the potential breadth of its applications.

Next, Chris Dannen, Founder of Iterative Capital, discussed the way work has evolved, particularly in the era of free open-source software. He explained how Decred's treasury brilliantly dovetails into a massive work trend that gives workers desired autonomy and enables them to do their best work.

Finally, Chris Burniske and Joel Monegro of Placeholder VC help a fireside chat explaining Decred's value from the perspective of an institutional investor. Chris revealed the financial reasoning, including:

1. Team - btcsuite when released was as good as anything put out by BTC Core
2. Hybrid PoW/PoS system is more secure than any other network
3. Treasury funding allows development to be funded long term
4. Fork resistance-Decred is designed to keep the community together through consensus

Joel shared his appreciation for Decred's governance system, and its ability to make Decred polymorphic, adding features and functionality as the community decides. They concluded that Decred is built/designed for a multi-decade horizon. They shared some of the good work they're doing to on behalf of Decred with respect to custodianship, exchanges, and institutional staking, and concluded that the biggest issue currently facing Decred is liquidity.

Founders Night took place Thursday, December 6th, and was Distributed Global's holiday party. They brought in all their GP's in from various offices, and invited their LP's, partners, and members of various projects within their portfolio. It was a great opportunity to meet those various constituencies and build relationships for future events in NYC. We're targeting the Spring for the next Decred event in NYC, looking forward to meeting more people and growing the community.

Upcoming:

* [10 lat Bitcoina](https://10latbitcoina.com.pl/) in Warsaw, Jan. 26th. @karamble will deliver a presentation at the conference celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper and Bitcoin itself.

Comm systems news:

* @dhill hunted down bridge bug https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/pull/644, but a few more bugs remain related to messages with attachments
* #smart_contracts channel was archived due to inactivity
* Rocket.Chat is being [retired](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/460)
* landing page for new matrix users https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/462
* issue tracker PoC, 35 issues
* a few threads were created that spurred useful discussion, and were later removed wasting the effort of all people who bothered to reply. Links to access deleted content were posted later. But generally this incident shows an attack/sabotage vector: trigger the discussion and then delete the thread, wasting community's energy. Reddit has no defence from it since moderators cannot disallow users to delete their content. {important. own paragraph?}

For yet another time, a lot of strange Reddit activity was timed close to our major release. It is either an unusual amount of questions about less relevant things, or "innocent" questions about trivial things, or something similar. All coming from accounts never seen before and that never stay. This notice is to inform people who care about the project to watch out for weird activity that can sap your project's, as well as your individual energy. Read [this chat](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$154531182347084ccYxu:decred.org) for more details.

[@Murad Mahmudov](https://twitter.com/muststopmurad) dropped into the Decred comms to share his thoughts about [the steps Decred should take](https://matrix.to/#/!MgQoetFiyjrHAywokv:decred.org/$15459293712709dEJuG:decred.org) to pave the way for its success by highlighting aspects that make it remarkably attractive as a Store of Value as it is
> hypersecure, smoothly-upgradeable, sustainable, unforkable, self-funding SoV with strict assurances and coinholders having more voice than other systems.

{PoW, ASIC resistance, tech}

Vertcoin (VTC) was the subject of a majority (51%) [attack](https://medium.com/coinmonks/vertcoin-vtc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-53ab633c08a4) (4 incidents) in which 22 reorgs and 15 double spends occurred, costing the victims around $100,000. This reaffirms the vulnerability of coins that are not the dominant use for their miners (GPU-mineable or ASIC-resistant, but also Bitcoin forks) to be attacked by miners who have appropriate hardware and no interest in the health of the blockchain. One of the impacts of these attacks is that the coin comes to be regarded as insecure, because it has failed in its purpose before. Anyone who is still willing to accept it may require a very high number of confirmations before confirming a transfer, making the coin slow to move.

The [Horizen (previously zencash)](https://www.horizen.global/) team lead recently announced a [strategic action](https://blog.zencash.com/re-strategic-actions-for-horizen-from-rolf-versluis/) to increase the Treasury block rewards from 10% to 20%, reducing the share of rewards for miners.  After a 90% reduction in price, and significant reductions to staffing and other costs, it was felt that to cut costs any further would mean jeopardizing the project. As the Treasury system being developed by IOHK is still a [prototype](https://blog.zencash.com/dao-prototype/) not yet ready for use, the team feel the need to make a unilateral decision to change the block reward. 

EOS block producer [began paying](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-node-offers-users-financial-rewards-for-votes-reignites-decentralization-debate) holders that voted for it.

The first round of voting on Aragon Governance Proposals (AGPs) has been [delayed](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-vote-delay-announcement/426) due to potential network instability around the Ethereum Constantinople hard fork - hopefully "blockchain down for maintenance" is not a problem Decred will encounter with Politeia. The CEO of Aragon Association [published](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-wishlist-and-blacklist/355) a blacklist and wishlist for proposals before proposal submissions opened. In the first proposal the AGP [process](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-1.md) itself was [approved](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) by 99.97% of the ANT that voted. In total 2.6% of all ANT tokens voted on the first proposal, from 45 unique addresses, with ~60% of ANT votes coming from one address. AGPs go through a review by the board of the Aragon Association, then a community review, before a 48 hour voting period opens. 

2 million BTCP were mined via an exploit and went unnoticed for months until CoinMetrics noticed something is wrong with the supply and [investigated](https://coinmetrics.io/bitcoin-private) it. Developer team [posted](https://medium.com/@bitcoinprivate/official-statement-on-coinmetrics-report-6f1cef176c05) an official statement confirming the inflation exploit. The bug was merged on Jan 5 together with a patch from a bounty hunter that disengaged after receiving the reward for his work. Just one missing line of code caused huge damage to the network's value proposition. We can take a lot from this unfortunate experience: extensive test coverage, super critical review of consensus code, established reputation of developers working on mission critical parts, and having multiple implementations of the protocol are all very important to build a system we can trust money to.

There was an [attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/a9yji3/electrum_wallet_hacked_200_btc_stolen_so_far/) on Bitcoin's Electrum infrastructure. Someone started a bunch of malicious Electrum servers that prompted the user to "upgrade" to a malware version and stole 200+ BTC. The Electrum model involves a network of servers that sit between clients and full nodes. Each client depends on the server they connect to, this compromises user privacy as the owners of those servers can infer which wallets the users own. If Electrum servers were compromised this would open up some additional attacks. Decred chose not to develop Electrum infrastructure but instead go straight for client-side filtering. This delayed the development of light clients, but the SPV mode now working in dcrwallet, Decrediton and drcandroid functions independently of any service provider and enhances users' privacy as a result. 

Security researchers [demonstrated](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9563-wallet_fail) multiple ways to hack most popular hardware wallets, if in physical possession of the device.

{DEX}

Latest exchanges volumes report by [blockchaintransparency.org](https://www.blockchaintransparency.org/) concluded that of the coinmarketcap.com top 25 BTC pairs over 80% of volume is wash traded. Another unhappy finding is that the average project spent over $50,000 on listing fees. The report has spurred [the idea](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/34) to analyze the trading volume of DCR.
