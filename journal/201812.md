# {DRAFT} Decred Journal â€“ December 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

{introduction, major news of the month}

## Development

{per-project summary, drop items without updates}

Unless there is a binary release, new features and bugfixes are available on the master branches of the projects. This means they passed review from multiple developers and can be built from source by developers and enthusiasts, but there are no end user installers until the next release.

For web based projects like Politeia, new merged work is usually available after the deployment which happens somewhere after the merge. For dcrdata block explorer, deployment is a bit more complex: new features go to master, are deployed to alpha, then to beta, and finally to stable. {keep or revert to per-project notice?}

[Horizen(previously zencash)](https://www.horizen.global/) recently announced a [strategic action](https://blog.zencash.com/re-strategic-actions-for-horizen-from-rolf-versluis/) in a blog post to increase the Treasury block rewards from 10% to 20% claiming a difficult choice was made by the team to reduce the amount of rewards for the miners.Consider they have planned a DAO treasury and voting system, with [prototype delivered](https://blog.zencash.com/dao-prototype/), this decision to change rewards without consensus voting from the whole community came a little surprising. {need polishing and improve writing}
