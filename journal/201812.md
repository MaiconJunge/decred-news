# {DRAFT} Decred Journal â€“ December 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

{introduction, major news of the month}

{if release comes out in Dec, remind to verify signatures. Decred is one of the few cryptocurrency projects that actually cares to sign releases and there is a good reasons for that. Make sure the software you install is coming untampered directly from the developers}

## Development

{per-project summary, drop items without updates}

Unless there is a binary release, new features and bugfixes are available on the master branches of the projects. This means they passed review from multiple developers and can be built from source by developers and enthusiasts, but there are no end user installers until the next release.

For web based projects like Politeia, new merged work is usually available after the deployment which happens somewhere after the merge. For dcrdata block explorer, deployment is a bit more complex: new features go to master, are deployed to alpha, then to beta, and finally to stable. {keep or revert to per-project notice?}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): On December 15th, RC1 (Release Candidate 1) of v1.4 [was announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/a6a5fz/dcrd_version_140_release_candidate_1/). This version includes [smart fee estimator](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1434), a long awaited feature that allows selections to either minimize mining delay or the fee rate, depending on what user needs. The feature is explained in detail in its [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412). Whitelisting peers is now supported [regardless of number of connections](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1516) allowing greater control over which nodes dcrd connects to, including wallets configured to use SPV mode.  Several performace improvements to initial sync, validation and network operations are included, users choosing to upgrade should note there is a one time data database migration to incorporate these changes which will take 30-60 minutes on average depending on hardware. The team [completed module versions bumps](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1541) in preparation of v1.4 release.

A vulnerability {link} was discovered in `go get` tool that allowed remote code execution when using a malicious repository. dcrd and dcrwallet were not affected because they recently switched to a more secure modules system. Latest versions of dependencies are not automatically grabbed like they are in npm. Additionally, for dcrd all changes to dependencies except the runtime are audited. That is part of the reason it takes so much effort to prepare dcrd releases and why the number of dependencies should be limited. Discussed in [this chat](https://matrix.to/#/!HEeJkbPRpAqgAwhXWO:decred.org/$154476448242812wqgkf:decred.org)

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): Tor connections from wallet to node will be available in the next release, development solved a proxy support issue [preventing connection from dcrwallet to dcrd via Tor](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1294). Capitalizing on sufficient network upgrades, modifications were completed to [reduce the default transaction fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1339) to 0.0001 DCR.

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): On December 16th, RC1 (Release Candidate 1) of v1.4 [was posted](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc1). Initial Trezor support [is included](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1547) allowing users to use Decrediton as a "watch-only" wallet signing transactions from Trezor. The feature will likely be hidden behind a config option until it gets enough testing.  Staking is not included in the initial version. Selecting SPV (simple payment verification) was made easier with a new [SPV selection page](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1766). Animations from [Eeter](http://www.eeter.co/) were [added for menu hover](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1816) along with a number of other style improvements including restyling [the governance page](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1844) and merging the requirements for [color themes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1749). Users of the Raspberry Pi (and other ARM processor device) will have access to Decrediton thanks to [work by MatheusD](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1904) (note that [Command Line App Suite](https://www.decred.org/downloads/) has always been available for Pi). [Various design fixes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1844), [big fixes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1874) and [required patches]() were implemented. An [updated version of release notes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1854) that allows translations and past information got included. A new feature to [contruct unsigned transactions](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1864) for watch-only wallets was developed (so transactions could be created on the watch-only wallet then signed and broadcast on the full wallet).

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): The latest [security tightening](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/935) {wait for merge} pushed Politeia's rating to A+ at [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/?q=test-proposals.decred.org&followRedirects=on), which has put it into the Security Headers top 3% and the Hall of Fame!  [Comment tally tracking](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/610) was added and an [admin restriction around proposal abandoning](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/936) was integrated.

[Horizen(previously zencash)](https://www.horizen.global/) recently announced a [strategic action](https://blog.zencash.com/re-strategic-actions-for-horizen-from-rolf-versluis/) in a blog post to increase the Treasury block rewards from 10% to 20% claiming a difficult choice was made by the team to reduce the amount of rewards for the miners.Consider they have planned a DAO treasury and voting system, with [prototype delivered](https://blog.zencash.com/dao-prototype/), this decision to change rewards without consensus voting from the whole community came a little surprising. {need polishing and improve writing}

EOS block producer [began paying](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eos-node-offers-users-financial-rewards-for-votes-reignites-decentralization-debate) holders that voted for it.

The Growing Focus on Blockchain Governance [article](https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/the-growing-focus-on-blockchain-governance) by Chris McCoy was discussed [in #governance](https://matrix.to/#/!tIDEIWechmqCLjPiui:decred.org/$154466528741798eoKOQ:decred.org) for it's strange interpretation of Decred's vote to choose a PR firm. It claims that the decision is called _"very basic"_ and _"day-to-day"_, that it distracts _developers_ and makes _the protocol_ susceptible to mob rule. The article comes for a founder of another project active in the governance domain.

{DEX}

Latest exchanges volumes report by [blockchaintransparency.org](https://www.blockchaintransparency.org/) concluded that of the coinmarketcap.com top 25 BTC pairs over 80% of volume is wash traded. Another unhappy finding is that the average project spent over $50,000 on listing fees. The report has spurred [the idea](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/34) to analyze the trading volume of DCR.
